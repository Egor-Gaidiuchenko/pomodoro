# Pomodoro Timer

This is typical pomodoro timer. All time divided on sets with long break between them. There is several number of circles with short break between them in each set. You can very flexible set up this timer.

### Technologies

This is my first project with React. I made it using class components. I used here SCSS preprocessor to style components and also tried to follow BEM.

### Features
